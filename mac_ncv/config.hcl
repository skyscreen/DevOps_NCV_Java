  # server, and instead communicate with the local Consul agent. There are many
  # reasons for this, most importantly the Consul agent is able to multiplex
  # connections to the Consul server and reduce the number of open HTTP

  # This prevents Vault from revoking the credential at expiration and Consul
  # Template having a stale credential.

  # Note: If you set this to a value that is higher than your default TTL or
  # max TTL, Consul Template will always read a new secret!

  # tokens be renewed at some regular interval or they will be revoked. Consul
  # Template will automatically renew the token at half the lease duration of
  # the token. The default value is true, but this option can be disabled if
  # you want to renew the Vault token using an out-of-band process.
